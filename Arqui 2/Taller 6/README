Copy the file to /mirror

	sudo cp saxpy_mpi.c /mirror/saxpy_mpi.c

Compile the file with 

	mpicc saxpi_mpi.c -o saxpi_mpi -fopenmp
	
Execute the file with 

	mpiexec -n 8 -f machinefile ./saxpi_mpi
	
	-n 8 defines the amount of processes
	-f machinefiles defines the addresses for the nodes and the split of the processes
	
Once the program is running wou'll be prompt to define 2 things
	
	Length of the vector
	Value of alpha


For dependencies of the program follow the specification for this workshop
