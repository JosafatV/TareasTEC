To create the cmake stuff do:

	# mkdir build && cd build

	# cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/home/josav/Documents/Git/TareasTEC/Embebidos/Taller9/build/usr -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/home/josav/Documents/Git/TareasTEC/Embebidos/Taller9/crosscompile.cmake

Then build the program:

	# make

The resulting files will be in the build directory and build/lib directory. They should look like the ones provied in bin

To use the library fist 

initialize the driver?
initialize the clock?
