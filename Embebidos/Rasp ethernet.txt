Change the interface config file

	sudo nano etc/network/interfaces
	
Change the eth0 interface to:

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
	address 192.168.0.123
	netmask 255.255.255.0
	network 192.168.0.1
	gateway 192.168.0.1
	
This sets the IP of the Rasp to static.

in /etc/hosts you can add an alias to the IP

	192.168.0.123 rasp

Connect to Raspberry Pi 2

	ssh root@192.168.0.123
	ssh root@rasp

Pass files to Rasp

	scp <source> <destiny>
